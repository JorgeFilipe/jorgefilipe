### Hi there :hand::sunglasses:

  I'm Jorge Filipe, I live in Brazil (:sunrise_over_mountains:). Currently working with Information Security, and Back-End Developer.

  I currently work with IBM's QRadar SIEM solution. I have 2 years of experience in cybersecurity, having participated in compliance projects with the General Data Protection Act (LGPD), and in security assessment projects focused on NIST.
