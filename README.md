### Hi there :hand::sunglasses:

  I call Jorge Filipe, and I'm from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I am currently majoring in Information Systems, and studying to be a Full-stack developer (I am also graduated in computer technician).

  In my free time I like to play video games (:video_game:), watch movies(:movie_camera:) and series(:tv:), study music (:musical_score:), make a beautiful guitar solo (:guitar:), or play that blues on the drums(:trumpet:).

  :mag_right: Would you like to meet me?
