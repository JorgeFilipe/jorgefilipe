### Hi there :smirk:

  I call Jorge Filipe, and I'm from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I am currently majoring in Information Systems, and studying to be a Full-stack developer (I am also graduated in computer technician).

  In my free time I like to play video games, watch movies and series and do a beautiful guitar solo, or play that blues on the drums.

  Would you like to meet me?
