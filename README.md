### Hi there :hand::sunglasses:

My name is Jorge Filipe, I live in Brazil (:sunrise_over_mountains:). I currently work as an Information Security Consultant and Back-End Developer.

I currently work on the engineering team using IBM's QRadar SIEM solution. I have 2 years of experience in cybersecurity, having participated in compliance projects with the General Data Protection Law (LGPD), and in security assessment projects focusing on NIST.

  :mag_right: Would you like to meet me?
